"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

Scenario 1:
In the story named Quarterly churn update, we can see that most of these customers gave a Churn Reason of “Competitor made better offer”. The implication is that a new competitor has moved in to the area and has stolen customers from the company.

Scenario 2
Of the customers that left, their Satisfaction Scores are all 1 or 2 for Churn Reason = Competitor had better devices and Product dissatisfaction. The implication is that the company’s Internet devices (e.g. modems) are problematic.

Scenario 3
Satisfaction Scores are low, ranging from 1-3, for customers that churned with Online Security=Yes.
The implication is that they disliked the company’s online security product or options.

Scenario 4
There is a trend that customers who churned were more likely to be on a Month-to-Month contract.The implication is that there is something about this contract type that is correlated with churn. Maybe it is easier to break a Month-to-Month contract?
